Project - Simulating the LC-3
=============================
Due Jun 3 by 11:59pm
Available May 11 at 11am - Jun 3 at 11:59pm 24 days

Purpose
-------
In this project you will integrate everything that you have been learning and building in the problems. So far you have learned how to simulate parts of a computer, the ALU and the CPU, and the Controller (FSM). You have also learned how to produce a debug monitor software that allows you to 'see' inside the computer as it operates. This has all been done with respect to a tiny computer specification, but the architecture of the simulation software is the same for any CPU you would like to simulate. Now it is time to apply this architecture to simulate a portion of the LC-3 to see how possible it is to do this.
Requirements

Use the textbook for your guidance to instructions, their formats, addressing modes, and CPU architecture. Applying the same basic approach that you used in the problems, implement the following LC-3 instructions such that your simulator can run a program assembled by the LC-3 editor. You will be able to run the program on the LC-3 book simulator to check the correctness of your results.
Teamwork

You are working in pairs but may divide the work as you think necessary. Make sure, however, that you are in constant communication, especially as regards the interfaces between partners' work when it comes time to integrate. You don't want any last minute surprises!
